            Hello. My name is Nathan and I am learning to become a web developer! After recently graduating with a B.A. in Psychology from UC Irvine, I decided to further my knowledge by attending a coding bootcamp program for web development through UC Riverside Extension. Although learning to program websites is a vast departure from the studies I did during undergrad, I have always been fascinated with technology and have always wondered about the possibilities of coding. That's why I'm glad to be able to participate in such an accelerated bootcamp to learn about how to create websites. So far I've enjoyed learning a lot from just the first week into the program and after completion, I hope to secure a job as a junior developer!
